# Enigma 

## Overview: 
This is my final individual project for Turing MOD 1 in BackEnd Progamming. 
In this project, I've used Ruby to build a tool that can encrypt and decrypts messages in txt files.

Areas of Focus: 
- Program planning 
- SRP 
- Test driven OOP
- File I/O

Self Assessment 
- Functionality: 3
- [x] Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. 
- [x] Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

- OOP: 3
- [x] Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated.
- [x] No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about

- Ruby Convention: 2.8
-[] Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long.
- [x] Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention.
- [x] Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job
- [x] At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

- TDD: 4 
- [x] Test coverage metrics show 100% coverage.
- [x] Mocks and/or stubs are used appropriately to ensure:
   - [x] testing is more robust (i.e., testing methods that might not otherwise be tested due to factors like randomness or user input)
   - [x] testing is more efficient
